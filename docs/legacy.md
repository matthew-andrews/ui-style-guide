# Legacy FT site (Falcon)

The current version of the FT website can often be referred to as the Falcon. It is not responsive but still adhere's to a grid system. Overlays, buttons and other elements are different to Origami

##Grid
The grid is based around the retrictive width of advertising on FT.com.

Full site width 972
Right-hand Rail = 352
Main content = 600

For additional styles of Falcon design elements within Ft pages please consult the <a href="http://financial-times.github.io/ft-velcro/">FT Velcro style guide.</a>

##links

###Standard links
Links on FT.com are FT blue and black on hover. There is no visited state colour

###Exception

Article titles appear on the homepage and section pages. This always appear in black and FT blue on hover.

##Colour pallette

There a 3 principal groups of colours used for FT products.

###Common colours

**FT Pink** - the background colour for FT.com, webapp and all FT products. FT pink is a crucial and first requirement when designing FT digital products.

**FT Blue** - used for links only

**Tint 1** - used to make the background colour of the Right-hand Rail 

**Tint 3** - used to make the header modules in the Right-hand Rail 


###Tints
Use a combination of these tints to create your page elements and differentiate different page elements. These tints are preferred to the exceptional colours in the Ancillary category below.

Tint 1

Tint 2

Tint 3

###Other colours

Claret is used for Special Report titles. This colour can be used as an accent colour for elements and designs that specifically need to stand-out strongly. FT Tints are used to seperate page elements and designs. Be warned that the Claret is used sparingly so don’t over-do it. 

Green - typically used for arrows, positive actions on marketing pages

Red - used for warnings and emergency messaging

##spacing

To keep gaps between visual units on the page we've created a standard spacing unit. A standard FT spacing unit is 20px.

##modules
A module is a container that holds a piece of content. They exist in the Main Content Column or in the Right-hand Rail (RHR) column.

All modules have a standard FT unit of space (20px) at the bottom.


###Main Content Column Modules
There are many different types of element that only appear in the Main Content Column. Page title, Secondary module, Content bundle and Midriff are the most common, see below

####Page title (Primary Level)
These are used on non-article pages to give the page a name. Note: Do not use standard article titles to create non-article page titles. This is referred to as a primary level item.

![Non article page header]({{site.baseurl}}/img/non-article-pgheader.png)

####Secondary module title (Secondary Level)
These appear most commonly on the homepage and different section home pages on the site (e.g. World, Companies, Markets, Global Economy etc). Section homepages are also commonly referred to as “index pages”. 

On the homepage for example the More Stories, Multimedia and Offers module use this style. See example below

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/multimedia.png" alt="module" width="836" height="362">
 
####Content bundle title (Tertiary Level)
This title is a collection of stories or content about a similar subject or a series of content that is deemed editorially to be relevant to with each other. The example below shows a list of columnists but this could also be stories or anything else.

![module]({{site.baseurl}}/img/content-bundle.png)

####Untitled content bundle (Tertiary Level)
This is a list of content which wont necessarily have a title. There are already a few types in existence, examples below; midriff and lists

####Midriff
A midriff is an small area that interrupts a list of articles to add some variation to the page layout. Midriffs are used to surface other content often unrelated to what’s on the page (but not always). The example below holds a list of articles from the UK section in the first column the left (A) and a single page Special Report in the second column on the right (B)

![module]({{site.baseurl}}/img/midriff.png)
 
> ###Footer Rule
> Insert footer under a module when it is followed by normal content. If a module is followed by another module do not use a footer. PASTE IMAGE

###Right-hand Rail Modules
These modules are stacked on top of each other on the right-hand side of the page. They are always 6 grid columns wide or 342px. There are 2 types.

#####Standard module header
Each module has a header with a tinted background. The text inside the module header is always capitalised. Never use lowercase.

![module]({{site.baseurl}}/img/midriff.png)

#####Tabbed module header
In certain circumstances the RHR module might need tabs. There two types;

__a) Minor Tabbed RHR module__

This contains a major title with minor titles aligned right and an arrow underneath each item to indicate the selected state. See example.

![module]({{site.baseurl}}/img/minor-tab.png)

__b) Major Tabbed RHR module__

This is only ever to be used for Fast FT
